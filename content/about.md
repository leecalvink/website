Hello, my name is Lee Kierstead and am a Courtesy Clerk in a busy store in the retail sector. I take joy in assisting people get what they need and ensuring their experience is a smooth one. Achieving this is done through empathy (active listening & understanding), staying optimistic and keeping the right tone. These are skills I carry inside and outside the workplace.

Currently I am a student attending {{<raw>}}<abbr title="Northern Alberta Institute of Technology">NAIT</abbr>{{</raw>}} in the [Network Engineering Technology](https://www.nait.ca/programs/network-engineering-technology) program. Technology is my jam. I probably spend an unhealthy amount of time in front of a computer screen in my spare time. One sign that I am a geek is I use [Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/) as my main {{<raw>}}<abbr title="Operating system">OS</abbr>{{</raw>}}. Thatâ€™s not to say I do not have other interests, I do.
