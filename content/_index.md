My name is Lee and this is my official home on the web. I am currently a student at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology here in Alberta pursuing an education in Network Engineering technologies. It isn’t my first time as a student as I already have a degree in an unrelated field (Political Science). It is my hope that my time with {{<raw>}}<abbr title="Northern Alberta Institute of Technology">NAIT</abbr>{{</raw>}} will enable me to gain employment doing something different and more fullfilling.

I am somewhat of a tinkerer with technology, at least on the software side of it. Linux has been my daily driver for over a decade and thus I have become very comfortable and familiar with a command line. However this doesn’t mean I am not open to using other operating systems. It is a personal pleasure to learn new software and ways of doing things. I envision myself someday being a system administrator of some type, preventing fires before they begin. You can [learn more about me here](/about/).
